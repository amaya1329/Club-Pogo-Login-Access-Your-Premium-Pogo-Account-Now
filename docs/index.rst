To successfully log into your Club Pogo account, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Navigate to the Pogo Website

Open a web browser of your choice (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, etc.) and navigate to the official Pogo website:

Once you are on the homepage, you will notice a *Log In* button in the top right corner of the screen.

### Step 2: Click on the "Log In" Button

Click the *Log In* button to be redirected to the login page. On this page, you will be asked to enter your login credentials, including your email address and password. If you have a Club Pogo membership, ensure that you use the email address associated with your premium account.

### Step 3: Enter Your Credentials

On the login page, you will see fields for both your *Email Address* and *Password*. These are the credentials you created when signing up for Club Pogo. Enter your email address and password correctly. Make sure your password is typed accurately, as passwords are case-sensitive.

- **Email Address**: The email address associated with your Club Pogo account.
- **Password**: The password you set during registration.

### Step 4: Click "Log In"

Once you've entered your credentials, click the *Log In* button to proceed. If your credentials are correct, you will be redirected to your Club Pogo dashboard, where you can start playing your favorite games and accessing exclusive features.

### Step 5: Troubleshooting Login Issues

If you encounter issues while logging in, there are several troubleshooting steps you can take:

- **Forgot Your Password?**
    - If you have forgotten your password, click on the *Forgot Your Password?* link below the login fields. You will be asked to enter your email address, and a password reset link will be sent to your inbox. Follow the instructions in the email to reset your password.

- **Account Locked?**
    - If you have tried to log in too many times with incorrect credentials, your account may be temporarily locked. If this happens, wait for a short period (typically 15-30 minutes) before trying again. If you continue to face issues, reach out to Pogo support for further assistance.

- **Clear Browser Cache and Cookies**
    - Sometimes, cached data can cause issues with logging in. Clearing your browser’s cache and cookies might resolve login problems. To clear cache and cookies, follow the instructions based on your browser:
